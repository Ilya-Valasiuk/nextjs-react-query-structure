# NextJS React Query Application Folder Structure

Welcome to the folder structure for your NextJS React Query application! Feel free to customize and adapt this structure to fit the unique needs of your project. Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to organizing your project folders.

## Folder Structure Overview

### api

- **common**
  - `types.ts` - generic types based on you API. Example: `PaginatedResponse<T>`.
- **[DomainName]**
  - `types.ts` - types only for this domain
  - `fetchers.ts` - pure JS fetchers for entities
  - `queries.ts` - react query hooks for entities

### app or pages

In the `app` or `pages` folder, define your application routes. Keep components free of logic and focus on loading data and rendering components from `/components/[page-name]/[PageName].tsx`.
